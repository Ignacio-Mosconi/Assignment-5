- nana & HS Library Integration

- Version 1.0 - Leaderboard test

WARNING: In order to run this project properly, nana's library files *MUST* be added to the "Dependencies\nana\lib" folder
located inside the solution directory; otherwise, there will be LINKING errors. The reason behind the exclusion of these library files
has to do with the fact that they're greater than 100 MB in size, so they cannot be pushed to a github repository as a result. The
solution that allows you to build the nana library yourself is found here:
- https://sourceforge.net/projects/nanapro/files/latest/download
Once you create the lib files (for both "debug" and "relese"), you should paste them inside the mentioned folder inside this project,
leaving their names as they are.
Sorry for this inconvenience.
